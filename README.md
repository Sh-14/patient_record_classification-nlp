Project Title:

Patient Record Classification using Natural Language Processing

Project Abstract:
The Patient Record Classification project focuses on categorizing electronic health records (EHRs) into key medical categories such as Diagnosis, Treatment, Medication, Test Results, and Outcomes. By utilizing Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system automates the classification process, improving efficiency in healthcare data management. The project explores various approaches, including traditional machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes), deep learning models (LSTMs, CNNs), and advanced pre-trained language models like BERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT. The goal is to evaluate and identify the best-performing model for accurate and scalable classification. This automation enhances clinical workflows, accelerates information retrieval, reduces manual workload, and supports predictive analytics, ultimately enabling smarter decision-making and improved patient care.

Conclusion:
This News Classification project demonstrates the potential of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Language Models for text classification tasks, particularly for categorizing news articles. The comparative analysis reveals that BERT, a transformer-based model, outperforms traditional methods and deep learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. By employing various algorithms, we gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, allowing us to choose the most suitable approach for news classification.
